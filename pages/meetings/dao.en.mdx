# Evmos DAO Meetings

## Purpose and Participation

DAO meetings are held weekly on every other Tuesdays at 5:00 PM UTC (10:00 AM PST, Wednesdays 2:00 AM KST) on a private channel but recorded for public viewing for [formal active workstreams](/governance/workstreams/current) as transparency is a core principle of our values. If a recording of the meeting is not able to be provided, formal DAO-funded workstreams are encouraged to provide a meeting minutes or summary. 

These meetings are generally held for DAO contributors in workstreams with the goal of providing updates, share and discuss ideas to improve our processes, and other important topics regarding the wellness and continued growth of the DAO and the Evmos ecosystem.
