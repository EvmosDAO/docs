# Core Definitions and Concepts

## Proposal Types

### On-Chain Governance

On-chain governance refers to all protocol level execution of proposals using Cosmos SDK's `gov` module. Anyone who holds or stakes EVMOS can participate in these votes, regardless of the voter's validator choices. 

### Off-Chain Governance

Off-chain governance refers to all community decisions that do not require an on-chain protocol-level change. These types of decisions include a wide variety of topics and concepts, from passing meta-governance proposals to the formation of special task forces or workstreams. 


<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
All proposals are assumed to be `On-Chain Proposals` until the necessary infrastructure and toolings for `Off-Chain Voting` is established. Cosmos SDK's `TextProposal` will be used for `Off-Chain Proposals` for the time being.

## Proposal Types by Category

### Protocol Proposals

| Module         | Codebase     | Parameters                                                                        | Description     |  
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------|
| `auth`         | `cosmos-sdk` | `MaxMemoCharacters` `TxSigLimit` `TxSizeCostPerByte` `SigVerifyCostED25519` `SigVerifyCostSecp256k1` | The auth module is responsible for specifying the base transaction and account types for an application. [Ref.](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/auth/06_params.html) |
| `bank`         | `cosmos-sdk` | `SendEnabled` `DefaultSendEnabled`          |The bank module is responsible for handling multi-asset coin transfers between accounts and tracking special-case pseudo-transfers which must work differently with particular kinds of accounts. [Ref.](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/bank/05_params.html)| 
| `distribution` | `cosmos-sdk` | `communitytax` `baseproposerreward` `bonusproposerreward` `withdrawaddrenabled` |This simple distribution mechanism describes a functional way to passively distribute rewards between validators and delegators. [Ref.](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/distribution/07_params.html) | 
| `governance`   | `cosmos-sdk` | `min_deposit` `max_deposit_period` `voting_period` `quorum` `threshold` `veto`  | The module enables Cosmos-SDK based blockchain to support an on-chain governance system. [Ref.](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/gov/06_params.html) | 

Additional Protocol Proposals: `slashing`, `staking`, `transfer`, `feemarket`, `claims`, `inflation`

### Community Proposals

Proposals that only require to be posted as a `TextProposal` on the Cosmos SDK - *Most commonly used for meta-governance proposals.*  

### Workstream & Special Initiatives

Proposals that requests any type of funding from the `CommunityPool` or the DAO's treasury to form an in-house workstream (team, squad, sub-DAO, guild) or project with the direct purpose of benefiting the Evmos ecosystem. 

- **Workstreams** are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Outreach, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).
- **Special Initiatives / Projects** are DAO-funded projects with a set budget and "completion" goal or date (i.e., Governance Tooling Project, Event Sponsorships, etc.)  

### Community Incentives Proposals

Proposals for DAO-funded Incentive Programs. **Not to be confused with Foundation Grants, or Community Pool Funding.** (i.e. Liquidity Bootstrapping Program - more details to come.)

| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------|
| `crisis`       | `cosmos-sdk` | `ConstantFee` |The crisis module halts the blockchain under the circumstance that a blockchain invariant is broken. [Ref.](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/crisis/04_params.html)| 
| `upgrade`       | `cosmos-sdk` | `MsgSoftwareUpgrade` | `x/upgrade` is an implementation of a Cosmos SDK module that facilitates smoothly upgrading a live Cosmos chain to a new (breaking) software version.  [Ref.](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/upgrade/)| 

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Emergency and Network Upgrade Proposals are exempt from following the Proposal Lifecycle Framework. The community is expected to do its due dilligence when such proposals are uploaded.

## Proposal Phase & Identification Tags

The following tags must be included in your initial Commonwealth threads **without a number attached**. During **Phase 2: ECP Formalization** a number will be assigned to the tag by a Governance Council member. These tags are for internal tracking and organization purposes. Check the [Proposal Submission Guidelines](/governance/proposals/submission) for instructions on how to include this tag for on-chain proposals. 

If your proposal type is not listed below, you do not need to include a tag.

- **Community Proposals** (Reserved for Gov. Framework Props): `[ECP-#]`
- **Workstream and Special Initiatives**: `[ECP-FUND-#]`
- **Community Pool Spend**: `[ECP-POOL-#]`
- **Community Incentives Program**: TBD
- **Protocol Incentives**: `[ECP-EVM-#]`
- **ERC20 Registration**: `[ECP-ERC-#]`

Alongside the proposal type identification, you must also include the Proposal Phase as denoted by: `[P1]`, `[P2]`, `[P3]`, `[P4]`, `[PASSED]`, `[REJECTED]`, `[DEFERRED]`
