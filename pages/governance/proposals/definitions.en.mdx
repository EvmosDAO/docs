# Core Definitions and Concepts

## Proposal Types

### On-Chain Governance

On-chain governance refers to all protocol level execution of proposals using Cosmos SDK's `gov` module. Anyone who holds or stakes EVMOS can participate in these votes, regardless of the voter's validator choices. 

### Off-Chain Governance

Off-chain governance refers to all community decisions that do not require an on-chain protocol-level change. These types of decisions include a wide variety of topics and concepts, from passing meta-governance proposals to the formation of special task forces or workstreams. 


<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
All proposals are assumed to be `On-Chain Proposals` until the necessary infrastructure and toolings for `Off-Chain Voting` is established. Cosmos SDK's `TextProposal` will be used for `Off-Chain Proposals` for the time being.

## Proposal Types by Category

### Protocol Proposals

| Module         | Codebase     | Parameters                                                                        | Description     |  
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------|
| `auth`         | `cosmos-sdk` | `MaxMemoCharacters` `TxSigLimit` `TxSizeCostPerByte` `SigVerifyCostED25519` `SigVerifyCostSecp256k1` | The auth module is responsible for specifying the base transaction and account types for an application. [Ref.](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/auth/06_params.html) |
| `bank`         | `cosmos-sdk` | `SendEnabled` `DefaultSendEnabled`          |The bank module is responsible for handling multi-asset coin transfers between accounts and tracking special-case pseudo-transfers which must work differently with particular kinds of accounts. [Ref.](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/bank/05_params.html)| 
| `distribution` | `cosmos-sdk` | `communitytax` `baseproposerreward` `bonusproposerreward` `withdrawaddrenabled` |This simple distribution mechanism describes a functional way to passively distribute rewards between validators and delegators.

| `governance`   | `cosmos-sdk` | `min_deposit` `max_deposit_period` `voting_period` `quorum` `threshold` `veto`  | The module enables Cosmos-SDK based blockchain to support an on-chain governance system. [Ref.](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/gov/06_params.html) | 

Additional Protocol Proposals: `slashing`, `staking`, `transfer`, `feemarket`, `claims`, `inflation`

### Community Proposals

Proposals that only require to be posted as a `TextProposal` on the Cosmos SDK - *Most commonly used for meta-governance proposals.*  

---

### Workstream & Special Initiatives

Proposals that requests any type of funding from the `CommunityPool` or the DAO's treasury to form an in-house workstream (team, squad, sub-DAO, guild) or project with the direct purpose of benefiting the Evmos ecosystem. 

#### **Workstreams** 

Workstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Outreach, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).

Workstreams are the sub-units of how Evmos DAO advances its purpose. A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos' Constitutional Values and community run initiatives. As such, ratifying workstreams sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Evmos DAO's governance.

Anyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered “informal.” A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the following criteria:

- Have a clear objective that aligns with Evmos' values and objectives as listed in the [Constitution](/constitution).
- Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing workstreams.
- Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes and all in line with the budget proposal flow.

Workstreams have five potential states. Each of the five states and the requirements for a workstream in each state are outlined below:

- **Informal:** The workstream is not funded by the DAO, and has not made a formal proposal with its goals and a budgetary request.
- **Proposed:** The workstream has made a formal proposal to the DAO for a working budget.
- **Probationary:** All new workstreams are under a mandatory 3-month probationary period in which future funding is decided on the performance and milestones met/unmet by the team.
- **Active:** The workstream is active and funded by the DAO. 
- **Inactive:** The workstream has been discontinued and is no longer being funded by the DAO.

#### **Special Initiatives / Projects** 

Special Initiatives and Projects are DAO-funded projects with a set budget and "completion" goal or date (i.e., Governance Tooling Project, Event Sponsorships, etc.)

### Community Incentives Proposals

Proposals for DAO-funded Incentive Programs. **Not to be confused with Foundation Grants, or Community Pool Funding.** (i.e. Liquidity Bootstrapping Program - more details to come.)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Emergency and Network Upgrade Proposals are exempt from following the Proposal Lifecycle Framework. The community is expected to do its due dilligence when such proposals are uploaded.

## Proposal Phase & Identification Tags

The following tags must be included in your initial Commonwealth threads **without a number attached**. During **Phase 2: ECP Formalization** a number will be assigned to the tag by a Governance Council member. These tags are for internal tracking and organization purposes. Check the [Proposal Submission Guidelines](/governance/proposals/submission) for instructions on how to include this tag for on-chain proposals. 

If your proposal type is not listed below, you do not need to include a tag.

- **Community Proposals** (Reserved for Gov. Framework Props): `[ECP-#]`
- **Workstreams and Special Initiatives**: `[ECP-WS-#]`
- **Community Pool Spend**: `[ECP-PS-#]`
- **Community Incentives Program**: `[ECP-IP-#]`
- **Protocol Incentives**: `[ECP-EV-#]`
- **ERC20 Registration**: `[ECP-ER-#]`

Alongside the proposal type identification, you must also include the Proposal Phase as denoted by: `[P1]`, `[P2]`, `[P3]`, `[P4]`, `[PASSED]`, `[REJECTED]`, `[DEFERRED]`
