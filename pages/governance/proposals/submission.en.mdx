# The Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Lifecycle

## Phase 1: Discussion & Ideation

The purpose of this phase is to vet ideas with the active Evmos community members. Each idea for a proposal should have its own Commonwealth thread, and discussions should be as narrowly focused as possible. Anyone can participate and is encouraged to provide feedback in this phase of governance. The goal of Phase 1 discussion is to gain a rough community consensus, and refine the idea so that it can be formalized. The thread author should make an effort to address all comments and take them into consideration.

## Phase 2: ECP Formalization

## Phase 3: ECP Signaling (Temperature Check)

## Phase 4: On-Chain Voting
