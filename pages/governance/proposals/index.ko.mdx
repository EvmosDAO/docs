# Community Proposals

## Evmos Community Proposals (ECPs)

ECPs are standardized proposals subject to voting that (once enacted) regulate and define the behavior of the Evmos DAO's Governance system, and provides a funding mechanism for special projects and workstreams. 

## The Evmos Community Proposal Framework (ECP-1)
