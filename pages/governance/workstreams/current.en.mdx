# Operating Workstreams

Workstreams have five potential states. Each of the five states and the requirements for a workstream in each state are outlined below:

- **âšª Informal:** The workstream is not funded by the DAO, and has not made a formal proposal with its goals and a budgetary request.
- **ðŸŸ¡ Proposed:** The workstream has made a formal proposal to the DAO for a working budget.
- **ðŸ”µ Probationary:** All new workstreams are under a mandatory 3-month probationary period in which future funding is decided on the performance and milestones met/unmet by the team.
- **ðŸŸ¢ Active:** The workstream is active and funded by the DAO. 
- **ðŸ›‘ Inactive:** The workstream has been discontinued and is no longer being funded by the DAO.

## Overview


| ðŸ”Œ  | Workstream  | Mission   | Budget  | Established  |

Decentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and often burdened with inefficient processes. It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can thrive.  

    <Values 
        mission="Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency." 
        vision="To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network."
        values="Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Neutral But Open-Minded"

<h4>Primary Duties</h4>

    <Divider sx={{ mt: 2, mb: 2, fontWeight: 700}} />

<div className="duties">

**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**

- The Constitution must be completed and amended as promised in Proposal 51, which ratified the *Interim* Constitution.
- The Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing a standardized way of interacting with the wider DAO and defining its future shape. It is crucial that we strive to continously improve our processes. 
- Governance processes that have been passed by the community must be implementated and enforced, if they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution. 
- We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance painpoints, shortcomings, and inefficiences. 
- We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.

**B. Growing Governance Participation & Engagement**

- The strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. 
- Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. 
- The Governance Workstream should aim to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.
- The Governance Workstream should work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process â€” for all members of the community.
- The Governance Workstream should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible. 

**C. Communication and Flow of Information**

- Effective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance. 
- The Governance Workstream should work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance â€” for all members of the community.
- The Governance Workstream must establish a more consistant, high quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.
- The Governance Workstream, when requested by the community, will act as a liasion to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. 
- The Governance Workstream will and must stay in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. 
- The Governance Workstream should strive to work with the Community Moderation team in the ideation of better communication initatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvement or clarifications.
- The Governance Workstream will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.
- The Governance Workstream will continue to attend, participate in, and â€” if needed â€” host the weekly Thursday governance calls on Discord.

**D. Governance and Proposal Framework Guidance and Feedback**

- The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.
- The Governance Workstream will strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral point of view.
- The Governance Workstream will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin ideating tools and resources for a more effective and user-friendly governance.

**E. Working Treasury Management**

- The Governance Workstream shall deploy the Evmos DAO's working treasury under a 5-of-7 multisig contract with 2 signatories from the Foundation, 2 validators, and 3 Council members.
- This contract will act as the DAO's treasury with liquid funds for contributor and bounty payments, community initiated projects and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.

**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Diplomacy**

- The Governance Workstream will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to collaborate. 
- The Governance Workstream will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initatives benefit the overall community of Evmos.

<h4>Special Projects & Initiatives</h4>

    <Divider sx={{ mt: 2, mb: 2, fontWeight: 700}} />

<div className="duties">

**A. Community Liquidity Incentives Programs** (In Progress)

- Although we have begun the "manual" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent "Kickstart Evmos DeFi" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process be determined by the community on a merit or milestone based system.
- In order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. 

**B. Off-Chain Community Governance Framework** (In Research)

- Off-Chain governance, in the context of Evmos DAO, can be explained simply as all governance decisions that do not need to utilize the Cosmos SDKs `gov` module.
- This is particularly an interesting topic, as it opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for conducting off-chain governance. For example, we are looking into [Conviction Voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475) as a possible way to make future incentive programs' distributions allocated by the direct community.
- Another example of our research into off-chain governance can be [viewed here](https://devfolio.co/projects/interchaindao-or-snapshot-proposal-to-cosmos-sdk-bebe) in which Snapshot, a very popular DAO platform for EVMs, was used to execute a testnet proposal. 

**C. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)

- The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.
- Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong.
- We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.

**D. Perpetual Bounty Program** (Planned)

- The Perpetual Bounty Fund will be a valuable tool for the DAO for access to liquid funds daily to sponsor community bounties and incentives. 
- This first of a kind experiment will be sponsored by the Foundation with a grant.

**E. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)

- The Governance Workstream is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.
- We strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to addresss all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.

**F. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)

- The Governance Workstream is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.
- Talks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.

**G. Improved Governance Dashboard & Toolings** (In Research)

- The Governance Workstream is ideating the potential value of creating our own governance dashboard.

<h4>Workstream Members and Organizational Structure</h4>

**Team Structure**

- The Governance Workstream will function as a two-level hierarchy, consisting of Council Stewards and Council Contributors. The key difference between stewards and contributors is that contributors are not required to manage the budget and that they are not directly answerable to Evmos DAO for failing to fulfill the workstream's duties and responsibilities.
- This difference in accountability means that decision-making power must lie in the hands of the stewards rather than the contributors, and is the reason for this explicit hierarchy.
- In practice, it is expected that Council Contributors and Council Stewards operate and communicate as equals. Stewards will seek to always consult Contributors when making decisions regarding the future of the Governance Workstream.

<ul>
    <li>Steward(s) / Leader(s): Who are the members managing the workstream and accountable for its outcomes?</li>
    <li>Members: who is committed to working on this project and what are their responsibilities?</li>
    <li>Compensation: what is the compensation amount per member, how will compensation work, and justify the amounts.</li>
